Choose this option if a prebuilt container already contains the model training libraries you need such as `tensorflow` or `xgboost` and you are just doing ML training and prediction quickly. You can also specific additional Python dependencies to install through the `CustomTrainingJob(requirements=...` argument.\n",

Use your own custom container image**: If you want to use your own custom container, you will write your Python training scripts and a Dockerfile that contains instructions on your ML model code, dependencies, and execution instructions. You will build your custom container with Cloud Build, whose instructions are specified in `cloudbuild.yaml` and publish your container to your Artifact Registry.
